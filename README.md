# Rainfall and Water-level Prediction
A script that works with given data on rainfall and affected water levels using machine-learning techniques 
via the sklearn module (Linear regression model specifically) to make predictions. Then taking the data and 
predictions made to produce a scatter plot with a linear regression line. Other Python files are 
also provided to show plot graphs of rainfall and water levels relevant to date. 

** HOWEVER THE RESULTS ARE STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND MAY NOT BE ACCURATE **

#Instructions
1) type one of the three .csv file names provided in the csv_output variable.
